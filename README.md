JavaScript Project game

* Project Title: Tile Smasher
* Background and Overview
    This game is a take on BrickBreaker which is a retro game. The key purpose of the game is to hit a ball with a paddle and navigate it so it goes and breaks all of the bricks without the ball going past the paddle. The game takes place on a single screen, the player is usually given three lives and their goal is to break all of the bricks on the screen without losing all their lives. 
* Functionality and MVP Features
   * Users can navigate with the mouse to hit the ball with the paddle.
   * Bricks will be randomly generated on the screen.
   * The game ends if the ball goes past the paddle 3 times.
* Architecture and Technologies

   * Vanilla JavaScript for game logic.
   * HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
   * Howler.js (or HTML audio player) for game background music.
   * Webpack to bundle various scripts into a single source.
